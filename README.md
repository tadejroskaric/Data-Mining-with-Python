# Data Mining with Python
Airline.py was created during the preparation of the Data Mining with Python scientific paper. In its essence, it's about exploratory data analysis of an airline passenger satisfaction dataset. We create some visualisations, a correlation matrix and also a machine learning model from which we extract the features that contribute to a positive satisfaction rating

The aforementioned paper is available in the Proceedings of the 6th FEB International Scientific Conference at: https://press.um.si/index.php/ump/catalog/book/679

The original dataset is in the appendix of the following paper: Noviantoro, T., & Huang, J.-P. (2021). Investigating airline passenger satisfaction: Data mining
